This model is written in C++. </b> The following instructions work have worked
under redhat linux 9 although
the code should work with little or no modification on other platforms with ansi compilers.<p/>
<h4>How to compile:</h4>
Change to the directory in which you have unziped the archieve file, then type:
<pre>
g++ network2D.cpp -lm -O4 -ffast-math -o n.exe
</pre>
<h4> How to run:</h4>
<pre>
n.exe input2D.txt > tmp &
</pre>
C++ code for simulating 2 layer 2D network (256x256
pyramidal cells - regular spiking
type and 128x128 interneurons - fast spiking type) of map-based neurons.
With some small modifications this code
was used to generate Fig 9A (right plot) in our JCNS paper.
Also there is a movie of spiral wave dynamics available (see pop-down
window above model files in ModelDB.
<p/>
<h4>
Making the movie with matlab:</h4>
Matlab scripts which create images which are then used to create the movie:
<pre>
import2D('graf_cx0')
movieMAP
</pre>
To assemble the images into the movie and then save the movie:
<pre>
for i=1:200; tmp=imread(['mov' num2str(i) '.png']); m(i)=im2frame(tmp); end;
movie2avi(m,'spiral2D.avi');
</pre>
<h4>Additional note:</h4>
The simulations with 256x256 require > 1GB RAM (otherwise there is a huge
time penalty for virtual memory use).
